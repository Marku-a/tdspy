"""
tdspy — Time Delay Stability (TDS) library
==========================================
General-purpose algorithm for detecting stable coupling between time-series signals.

Based on:
  Bashan et al., Nature Communications 3:702 (2012)
  Bartsch et al., PLoS ONE (2015)

Original MATLAB implementation by Ronny Bartsch.
Python port and generalization by Asaf Markuza.

Quick start
-----------
>>> import tdspy
>>> result = tdspy.tds(s1, s2)
>>> print(result['score'])   # TDS % in [0, 100]
